All they want you to do is take their word for how great the room is send you some generic pictures and ask for your security deposit without getting to see the room. To contact anybody with any ads you have to do the paid subscription. Roomster will be very happy to charge your card every week but even if you uninstall the app they will continue to charge your card. you have to cancel the subscription through Google.","1, 5, 6"
2,sha@uninsubria.it,2,"Not useful while previously free features now require a subscription. I recommend Global Entry as an alternative that is about $25 more per year but also includes PreCheck. Additionally, in all cases I have used the app, customs funneled all passengers into a single line once baggage was claimed, negating the time savings achieved. Edit: To clarify, paid features didn't justify the cost. Security/privacy best practice is to store personal info on device and encrypted.","1, 4"

4,sha@uninsubria.it,4,"I lived here 4 years all of the staff is wonderful. Security, maintenance, and the girls at the office and the front gate know my name.This is a very large complex but its like a hometown. Neighbors are all friendly and even offer me rides to the store.The corporation rightly should provide a shuttle bus like all the other Carlton arms communities for the elderly,disabled and people that don't drive.Why is this location with 900 apartments different?",0
5,sha@uninsubria.it,5,"Seems good so far, but the 20 character limit for passwords makes me question the  security a bit.  That's long for many apps, but, I would think, most people who focus on security first (which is what you want in a developer for an app like this) would make it 32 or more.","1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
6,sha@uninsubria.it,6,This is the best security app you must have on your phone. I just love the app 😘😘,"1, 2, 3"
7,sha@uninsubria.it,7,"Start early and make sure you have a good data wifi connection. I tried to use this at Ft Lauderdale, and the steps worked ok until I got to submit. Then I was misinformed by the app and one of the security personnel that I just needed to do one for both my wife and I. You need to scan all passports. DON'T HIT SUBMIT UNTIL YOU HAVE ADDED OR SCANNED ALL PASSPORTS, OR YOU HAVE TO RE-ADD ALL PREVIOUS PASSPORTS. In the end, it would have been quicker to just use the kiosks.",0
8,sha@uninsubria.it,8,"The only Gimp here is the Dev who thought using VNC to connect to a computer under a shared user profile was a good idea for an app that may house sensitive documents. You can literally get onto the desktop of the machine by complete accident and view other users files...Lost for words...   People, stay well away from this massive data security risk!",1
9,sha@uninsubria.it,9,"When it works it is a brilliant little app. But over the last few days it has been hit & miss on connecting, and today (28th) it has been down all day. Absolute nightmare accessing any sites, as all my passwords are complex, and stored here. Note to self; keep a back up list somewhere, although that does rather undermine the security.",0
10,sha@uninsubria.it,10,"A very simple App that is well written by the McAfee software folks. I did rate it a five although I believe it can be improved on, but not enough to change my thoughts about it. I would surely recommend it to us McAfee Total Protection owners, as it works as smoothe as a gravy sandwich on this security App. You shouldn't have problems if you use it as a ""Stand Alone"" manner either. Good Luck",0
11,sha@uninsubria.it,11,I gave to lower the security settings on my new phone in order to install app from this. Not happening,1
12,sha@uninsubria.it,12,"Huge privacy concern even during the app setup. It needs location data to finish setup. I mean why. Why a toothbrush app needs to know my location? Why Philips tracks my location just to brush my teeth? Also, if I do not share lots of my brushing data, it would not let me finish the app setup, even though, it has a Maybe Later option, but that option just kills the setup process. Why can't some of the private data saved locally on phone? I will give the app a couple of tries and if I do not like it, I will just uninstall it.","1, 3, 4"
13,sha@uninsubria.it,13,"I don't know why everyone is complaining, this app may not be perfect but what app is. They have so many devices they have to contend not to mention the many different versions of each device. This app is very user friendly and for someone like me with so many accounts to handle it is a dream come true and being by McAfee l trust they are doing their best to wait out for my security. Thanks guys for this program keep up the good work.",0
14,sha@uninsubria.it,14,"Edited:[McAfee don't provide any decent support, they lie. I completely lost my account. Impossible to recover it.] Never trust this app. It's dangerous. Once you don't remember your master password and don't have a trusted device, you'll completely lost access to your all stored password and your main account. This app is a deprecated way of security. Just old people developing old bureaucracy false believing it's secure.","1, 2"
15,sha@uninsubria.it,15,"Sling uses AD Choice to run commercials on this app. Which, means it collects data as well, and sells it to big corporations like ORACLE, Google has a Class Action on them for after Opt-Out option is applied they still continue to track your privacy. There will be a time where people will stop using cell phones. Also, the best at anytime you'll receive 720p resolution. Pay for what you get at best.","1, 6"
16,sha@uninsubria.it,16,"Please add some more features 1) Add zoom in and zoom out button for graph in QA section.(difficult to calculate value in mobile view) 2.) OB main aim is to help students in clearing the examz so pls add reattempt mode button for test, so that we can attempt test for better practise or if this ur concern for security then limit the attempts to 2. 3) Under Mock test Open any test->open filter screen -> instead of showing tabs like attempted,unattempted and bookmarks show grid view of questions and give colors to it (check the UI of ibps exam and gradeup AP) In this way it takes less time for us to navigate to particular question. 4) Try to make UI like Ibps actual exam. It will help us better to used to with the Actual exam UI. Please consider my listings. OB Rocks!",0
17,sha@uninsubria.it,17,👎😨👎😵👎😨👎😵👎No mention of security for data synchronisation. Will Google be able to read all my data or synchronised notes??? ⭐Must provide method to export CSV and extract data from app! Otherwise useless like others not offering free export/import! (or limitation of 1 backup per week/month) 👍😣👍😣👍,0
18,sha@uninsubria.it,18,I like that I can have it to where I have to use a password or number code to get on it so I don't have to worry about someone reading my notes. If I'm not mistaken I think you can use a pattern for security as well. It's super easy to use and my favorite part is that I can make each note a different color. Nice colors too. Would definitely recommend.,1
19,sha@uninsubria.it,19,"Only App that gives an Air Index forecast. And, it's as reliable as most weather forecasts. I like the simplicity and ease of navigating across the various menu options. A quick scan of, yet not a deep dive into, the Privacy Policy looked acceptable. I'm gonna keep it. Check w/me in Fifteen minutes, hours, days et cetera. More is often revealed, in time... 8>)","1, 2"
20,sha@uninsubria.it,20,"Very invasive, intrusive app. You can only log in with facebook, and the app pulls all your private info from your facebook that you would normally share with your close friends, and displays it on your roomster profile for all to see. This is a gross breach of privacy. I would advise others not to use this app.","1, 3, 5"
21,sha@uninsubria.it,21,"While the app itself loads and seems useful, it is supposed to be a Radar Widget. In this regard, it will load data and gives me the retry attempt which has failed each time. Please work to fix as this and it will be amazing, because you cannot find Apps that do this other than Rain Viewer which is good, but has its own glitches. (Dvlpr Note: Samsung A50 w/ Android 10++ Verizon Security Updates)",0
22,sha@uninsubria.it,22,This is a very good learning platform but for 3 months I am facing one major issue on this app. Issue: I have registered for Master's in Cyber Security program (expensive course). Problem is it doesn't sync up the progress of the course in Mobile app as well as web. It very irritating because you have to start over again and again to complete trainings to unlock certificates. My only intention of this feedback is to get this sorted ASAP because its becoming waste of time and money 😒.,0
23,sha@uninsubria.it,23,I thought it was very nicely designed. I wish I was able to trust it to secure my phone. It doesn't.... it does a few times here and there but its pretty useless for security. Only thing is nice is the design. I will uninstall until it can be a reliable app to lock my phone.,"1, 2"
24,sha@uninsubria.it,24,Its easy to use and the wallpapers are lovely. Although i think a security measure  setting should be added in the case that someone attempts to delete the app.,1

26,sha@uninsubria.it,26,Junk! Main purpose seems to get you to accept their SPAM and automated billing. Their Network Troubleshooting is a invasion of your privacy as it requires their router and logs into it. This would grant them access to anything on your network. There's more to network diagnostics then router configurations and should warn users before attempting anything this intrusive.,"1, 3, 4"

28,sha@uninsubria.it,28,"Dont bother getting this. All the delivery people are rebelling, stealing the grocery orders because Amazon barely pays them. I've had 2 separate $60+ orders this week get ""delivered"" to someone/anyone other than me. Security cameras from my building office prove no one even approached for entry nor did I receive a call. And Amazon customer service is nonexistent, holding on to your money for days even if you never receive anything. They will further insult you by offering very low credit.",0
29,sha@uninsubria.it,29,"i have sold cars and also bought cars through this jiji app, it is the best place of selling and buying, my advice to you, don't give rooms to 419 people, make your security stronger. I am giving you my 5 Star...thanks to the producer of the app.","1, 2"

31,sha@uninsubria.it,31,"I will never use this app again! It is the most confusing app I have ever used. I went around and around registering the app so that I could retrieve e-tickets to a spring training baseball game that I paid for.  My credit card had been charged. I created a new account on VividSeats and went to retrieve the tickets. the app asked for my user name & password (that I had just created). I entered it and received a message of ""invalid email address"" (I also received a verification of registering in my normal email so I know that I entered the email address correctly.) I contacted support and was told that I had a ""security problem"" in my computer. I tried again from the Macintosh, from a cell phone, then from an iPad. I received the same error on all three devices. Support then said that I have a ""security problem"" in my network. In the cell phone, I switched off wi-fi so that I was now using the cell company's network.  Same problem. Support suggested I have somebody look at my network problem. On all 3 devices, using 2 different networks?   I managed to transfer the messages to my account, according to a message on screen. But the tickets still do not show in my app.","1, 4, 5"
32,sha@uninsubria.it,32,"Was not sure how this would compare to PasswordBox which was my previous app for this type of stuff.  So far not as bad as I thought.  Still does all the things I used to do,  but now with a better choice of Internet apps to use to open logins in (previous app was just inapp or in Chrome).  The PC version won't work on company laptop however due to internal IT security settings (Not Intel's issue!)   Overall have to say this is a good app which just takes getting used to (no one likes change!)",1
33,sha@uninsubria.it,33,"Very good app, fairly easy to use. The company behind it can at times have less than ideal practices such as agressive online tracking and advertising, but people who are a little privacy focused can easily adjust that, so I use it with pleasure.",0
34,sha@uninsubria.it,34,All people yawning here about is that app not works. Nobody is concerned about privacy? This app literaly can read and controll anything that is going on your screen. Permissions you where giving are: 1. Read all screen content and controll screen 2. Learn your behaviour and automate actions Thats what my phone said when I tryed to give it permissions. NO THANKS. Nobody will read my screen content or learn my behaviour. I never tryed app so I dont know if it's working or not.,"1, 4"

37,sha@uninsubria.it,37,I just bought a Nexus 6 yesterday and updated to 5.1.1 and I another Stage Fright detector app and that said my phone was vulnerable to Stage Fright luck from my Moto G backup I had avast and the other Stage Fright detector app was a virus avast got rid of it. The Stage Fright detector app says I'm not vulnerable which I know shouldn't be because Google sent out an update with a security fix to Nexus phones. If anyone is looking for a Stage Fright download this one as this is the one that can be trusted.,0
38,sha@uninsubria.it,38,"The worst invasion of privacy. They force you to sign in ONLY with your facebook profile and then take all your personal information very private stuff and add it to your listing. I was looking for a room to rent, i paid their membership fee and i had to cancel it because I couldn't get my facebook info off my ad for needing a room. I hate this app. And their supprt does not reply to anything. Do not waste your money unless you want your pvt info to be blasted.","1, 3, 5"
39,sha@uninsubria.it,39,"Stores credentials, generates random passwords, and for many sites it actually will take you there and log you in. Synchronizes across various devices. PROS: Facilitates strong, secure and unique passwords for all sites. CONS: it is specific to the Chrome browser where it runs as a Chrome extension. Support is arduous. I do not like Google and Microsoft browsers for privacy reasons and True Key no longer appears to work with Firefox. I intend to dump True Key for a better solution.","1, 2, 3"
40,sha@uninsubria.it,40,"Cheating, they take personal data and refuse you to login until approval. And you can't even see the privacy policy. I wouldn't have downloaded if I knew I have to receive some approval before I can login and see what is inside.","1, 3"

I kept getting pop-up asking to upgrade my phone or that my phone is infected with virus etc and keeps going to playstore making it impossible to shop leisurely.

However, I don't understand why I have to enable my location, unless I want to watch a local channel.  As a result, I can't watch with my wifi privacy app, because the latter uses a VPN.

50,sha@uninsubria.it,50,This app saves me sometimes. I know most people probably use it to keep track of notes etc but for me it's my electronic diary. Growing up my privacy was constantly violated and any time I ever wrote something in my diary I had to hide it in the wall so no one could get to it and read it causing a lot of distrust with others and extreme anxiety as I got older but this app is very secure and I love that it helps me get all my feelings out and feel safe.,0
