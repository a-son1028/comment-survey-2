All they want you to do is take their word for how great the room is send you some generic pictures and ask for your security deposit without getting to see the room. To contact anybody with any ads you have to do the paid subscription. Roomster will be very happy to charge your card every week but even if you uninstall the app they will continue to charge your card. you have to cancel the subscription through Google.",your card,5

Additionally, in all cases I have used the app, customs funneled all passengers into a single line once baggage was claimed, negating the time savings achieved. Edit: To clarify, paid features didn't justify the cost. Security/privacy best practice is to store personal info on device and encrypted.",,4

That's long for many apps, but, I would think, most people who focus on security first (which is what you want in a developer for an app like this) would make it 32 or more.",Seems good so far,2

Why Philips tracks my location just to brush my teeth? Also, if I do not share lots of my brushing data, it would not let me finish the app setup, even though, it has a Maybe Later option, but that option just kills the setup process. Why can't some of the private data saved locally on phone? I will give the app a couple of tries and if I do not like it, I will just uninstall it.","I mean why.

Once you don't remember your master password and don't have a trusted device, you'll completely lost access to your all stored password and your main account. This app is a deprecated way of security. Just old people developing old bureaucracy false believing it's secure."," Edited:[McAfee don't provide any decent support, they lie.

A quick scan of, yet not a deep dive into, the Privacy Policy looked acceptable. I'm gonna keep it. Check w/me in Fifteen minutes, hours, days et cetera.

This is a gross breach of privacy. I would advise others not to use this app.","Very invasive, intrusive app. This is a gross breach of privacy.",3

11,sha@uninsubria.it,23,I thought it was very nicely designed. I wish I was able to trust it to secure my phone. It doesn't.... it does a few times here and there but its pretty useless for security. Only thing is nice is the design. I will uninstall until it can be a reliable app to lock my phone.,pretty useless for security.,2

Private Notes had all the bells and whistles and was a free download 😉 After a bit the owners offered an enhanced, supplemental add-on. I bought it and thoroughly enjoy the extra work space and security. I like the ease of working with this app and would recommend it to family and friends,,, but,,,That's just My Opinion. Good Day!!! 🇺🇲", I bought it and thoroughly enjoy the extra workspace and security.,2
20,sha@uninsubria.it,39,I really like this app. It connects and plays as soon as I get in my car. It sounds so much better than other music apps that I have downloaded on my phone. Recently I received a Privacy Alert from my Anti Virus stating that this app was sending some of my information to Facebook! NOT GOOD AT ALL!! What happened to the Shuffle and Repeat icons?, this app was sending some of my information to Facebook,6

23,sha@uninsubria.it,44,"THIS APP IS A CLIPBOARD SNOOPER. The new version of Android implements a security feature that notifies you when an application accesses the contents of your clipboard. Almost every time I start this app I get a pop-up stating that ""Krazy Coupon Lady pasted from your clipboard."" There is absolutely no legit reason for this to be happening, and it's not trustworthy app behaviour. ETA: Clipboard access does NOT require any special permissions to be granted, as it's a basic OS function. The issue is that it's being accessed on startup, unexpectedly and unnecessarily. I'd paste a screenshot if I could, but anyone running Android 12 will see the same notification that their clipboard has been accessed. I'm not arguing that this app is necessarily misusing this feature, but as I have no way of knowing what it's doing with my data, I cannot trust it.",,4
